Terminal 2.0

The terminal package has seen a little make-over.
Nothing major you should notice, except:

Key bindings are no longer enabled by default.

The original key bindings were masking built-in binding of Sublime Text itself.
To restore the bindings, or create different ones, edit your bindings file:
Preferences > Package Settings > Terminal > Key Bindings

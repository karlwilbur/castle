This is my [castle](http://www.rocu.de/manage-and-share-your-dotfiles-with-homesick/). There are many like it but this one is mine! 

My castle stores my [dotfiles](https://dotfiles.github.io/). It is my configuration. I must master it as I must master my life.

Without my configuration, my machine is useless. Without my machine, I am useless. I must keep my configuration true.

Installation
------------
I use the Homesick gem to install and manage this castle.
